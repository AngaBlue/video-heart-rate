# üìä Video Heart Rate

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) uses cameras to non-invasively monitor vital signals like heart rate, offering contactless monitoring with potential for remote healthcare applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
At the root of the project (`video-heart-rate`) run the following to set-up with Python virtual environments:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then activate the virtual environmental and install dependencies with:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development
To speed up processing, the video can be degraded significantly to reduce unnecessary information using the following command.

```bash
ffmpeg -y -i .\videos\angus.mp4 -c:v libx264 -vf scale=144:-2 -r 5 -an -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 20 .\videos\angus-degraded.mp4
```

This will:
 - Re-encode the video with H.264
 - Reduce the framerate to 5 FPS.
 - Reduce the resolution to 144p.
 - Set the constant rate factor (CRF) to 20.

## üìù Notes
The pause functionality only works if the CV window is active.
