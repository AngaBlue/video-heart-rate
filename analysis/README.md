# 📊 Video Heart Rate Analysis System

A modular Python system for investigating heart rate estimation techniques on pre-recorded video, with support for applying video degradations and generating comparison plots.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. 📁 Place a Video & Ground Truth Data

Put your input video and ground truth data in the `videos/` folder. For example:

```
videos/sample1.mp4
videos/sample1.csv
```

_**Note**: videos and ground truth data added to this folder are git ignored, meaning they won't be committed to avoid filling the repository with large files._

The CSV ground truth data should adhere to the following format:

```csv
timestamp,heart_rate
0,72
1,73
2,71
...
```

Missing timestamps will be automatically interpolated.

### 2. ▶️ Run the CLI

Use the `main.py` script to apply one degradation technique and evaluate multiple HR measurement techniques:

```bash
python main.py --video angus.mp4 --degradation spatial_resolution --methods green_avg
```

This will:
 - Apply multiple levels of spatial resolution degradation.
 - Measure average heart rate from each degraded video using selected methods.
 - Save results in `results/` and generate comparison metrics plots.

## 🧩 Adding a New Degradation Method
Each degradation module must:
 - Be placed in the degradation/ folder.
 - Export a function `apply(input_path: str) -> Generator[Tuple[str, str]]`.
 - Yield (`degraded_video_path`, `label`) for each output version.

For example, a colour quantisation/bit-depth degradation would be written as follows:
```python
def apply(input_path: str):
    for bits in [8, 6, 4]:
        # create quantized video...
        yield output_path, f"{bits}-bit"
```

## 🧠 Adding a New HR Measurement Technique
Each method must:
 - Be placed in the `measurement/` folder.
 - Export a function `measure(video_path: str) -> np.ndarray` that returns a time-series signal (e.g., HR over time).

For example, a green channel over face ROI would be written as follows:
```python
def measure(video_path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    # extract green channel, average over face ROI, etc.
    return np.array([...])
```

## 📈 Adding a New Metric
Each metric must:
 - Be placed in the `metrics/` folder.
 - Export a function `plot(truth: Dict[str, Dict[str, np.ndarray]], results: truth: pd.DataFrame, x_label: str = "Degradation Level": str) -> void` that returns nothing.

For example, an average HR metric would be written as follows:
```python
def plot(truth: Dict[str, Dict[str, np.ndarray]], results: pd.DataFrame, x_label: str = "Degradation Level": str) -> void:
    # plotting setup...
    for method, by_deg in results.items():
        for degradation, measured in by_deg.items():
            aligned_truth = interpolate_hr_to_frames(truth, measured)
            truth_hr = aligned_truth[:, 1].astype(float)
            pred_hr  = measured[:, 1].astype(float)
            # metrics calculation...
    # complete plotting...
```

## 📈 Output
The system saves:
 - Degraded videos: `results/<video>/degraded/<technique>/<label>.mp4`
 - Measured Heart Rates: `results/<video>/measured/<method>/<technique>/<label>.npy`
 - Plots: `results/<video>/plots/<metric>.png`
